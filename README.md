# Tanner_FitzGerald_Portfolio
This portfolio is a collection of program files that showcase what I've been working on since starting my associates of computer science at NVCC. I started learning in Python, then Java.

Most of the programs here are from class assignments, but some of them are personal projects I have done to practice coding and/or to teach myself Java after learning python.
